Title: An Example of Creating an R Package with Functions Implemented
        in C++ using Rcpp

Description: This project uses Rcpp to create an R package implemented in C++.
    I use Roxygen2 to manage documentation, which turns specially formatted
    comments into .Rd files. These are the help files displayed when you
    run ?foo() in the R console, where foo() is a function. 
    The package consists of templated C++ functions for generating random
    combinatorial objects and random numbers from different distributions
    using algorithms described in the book Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation 
    by Luc Devroye.
    Random number generators for various distributions are needed for many 
    applications, such as sampling or modeling stochastic processes. 
    This package provides multiple implementations of generators that come with
    performance trade-offs, so users can choose the implementation best suited
    to their needs.
